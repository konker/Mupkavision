# Mupkavision
=============================================================================
  - A live display for essential information for the elderly
  - Fundamental:
    - Greeting
    - Date
    - Time
  - Also:
    - Times in other timezones
    - Media gallery
    - Reminders
    - Contacts
  - Important:
    - Ship basic version as soon as possible to see if it has any utility
      - Can be updated remotely to fix issues/develop new features
      - Hardware failure will need Gushka/Vino intervention

## Technical
  - Raspberry Pi based
  - HDMI to TV
  - Tailscale for connectivity
    - If accessible, can be updated, restarted, etc
    - Needs to be bootstrapped with New Pri WiFi
 
## Frontend
  - React?
    - Solid?
    - Svelte?
  - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)?
    - "design system"?
  - [Styled](https://styled-system.com/)?

### Technical Issues
  - If power is cycled (to TV and/or MV unit), will everything wake up as desired?
    - MV can boot into X and Kioski mode
    - WIll TV be on by default? Probably not.
    - Will TV wake up with last input source selected?
  - Does the picture need to be constantly changed to keep TV on?
  - Could we "sleep" between the hours of 22:00 - 08:00?
- Can we detect if the HDMI out is being "consumed" or not?
    - Not currently visible from Tapo, so how do we know if it is on? 
    - Perform automated actions according to HDMI detection?
      - Switch on TV
  - ERMM!!
    - Is this a disastrous waste of electricity/money?
      - TV on all the time as opposed to never

## IDEAS
  - Sheety for data/CMS
    - Allows others to edit/etc
  - Somehow sleep at night?
    - But be able to switch back on, including TV
  - IR blaster connected to unit, so:
    - TV can be switched on (soft)
    - HDMI source can be selected (?)
  - Motion detector:
    - Low res:
      - Jiggle UI elements when motion detected (Tombi??)
    - High res:
      - Detect person/Mupka via computer vision
      - Can Tapo be used here somehow?
  - Media gallery rotates with fade effects/etc
    - Can we also have video?
    - No audio by default
  - Icons to denote times of day:
    - morning
    - afternoon
    - evening
    - night
  - Different "screens" for configured times of day?
    - E.g. 10:00 - 11:00: "CARER, PLEASE GIVE PILLS"
    - E.g. 17:00 - 18:00: "CARER, PLEASE WARM UP FOOD, AND TAKE OUT NEW FOOD FROM FREEZER"
  - Messages:
    - Edit data source to send message to Mupkavision
      - "Chupping from Sydney!"
    - Not clear: TTL
  - Contacts:
    - List of phone numbers: Gushka, Googush, Cioc, Konrad.
  - Reminders:
    - E.g. "Kingushka's birthday on the 12th!"
      - Has start and end date for display
        - In resolution of days, e.g. 10th - 13th
    - Feed cat?
      - Would require (flaming loud) audio alarm?
  - Timezones:
    - Display of current time in different timezones:
      - London
      - Warsaw
      - Helsinki
      - Sydney
    - Should not confuse the current local time (a fundamental)

## NOTES
  - Cannot overwhelm the display with information
  - Fundamental information must be constant, and readable
    - Greeting
    - Date
    - Time
  - Other information can be rotated?
    - Media gallery:
      - Fade out/in one or more assets?
      - Assets on a slowly moving carousel?
      - Assets periodically overtake the whole screen?
        - NO: cannot remove fundamentals
  - Concern about information density:
    - Fundamentals (A given)
    - Media
    - Timezones
    - Reminders
    - Contacts
    - Messages
  - Information must be as constant as possible so that familiarity and trust can be developed
    - Cannot have too much
    - Cannot have information moving around
    - Cannot have any fundamentals changing/moving/varying
  - Variation?:
    - Possibly have (gently) rotating/changing media to provide interest?
    - Some colour variation?
      - Different day of the week has different BG colour/theme?
        - Linked to coloured doset box?!
  - Bible stuff?
  - Popup message from turtles?
    - E.g. Popup every 5 mins during message lifetime window
